# IGOS 25 – A Human-Centered, Modern Indonesian OS

**IGOS 25** is a refreshed visual prototype of Indonesia’s local Linux-based operating system project (Indonesian Goes Open Source), focused on:
1. Intuitive, elegant modern visuals
2. Clean and human-centered user experiencE
3. Strong local identitY
4. Compatibility with present-day needs

IGOS once survived through nationalism. Today, it must survive through love from its users.

## Vision
To revive the IGOS spirit — not just as a free OS, but one that is:
1. **Usable** in daily life  
2. **Proudly local**, and  
3. **A serious alternative** to proprietary systems

## Visual Identity
- **Nirmala Aesthetic**: soft, breathable, light

## Inspired by:  
  - **MacOS** (Sierra–Tahoe)  
  - **Windows 11**  
  - **HarmonyOS Next**  
  - **Fedora**  

## Key Features (Prototype)
- Wallpaper picker with responsive layout
-  Modular components (Buttons, Popups, Notifications, Settings, etc.)
-  Multilingual-ready (Bahasa Indonesia as default)

## Project Status
Currently in **Visual Prototype** phase.  
UI is designed entirely in Figma with open opportunities for community collaboration.

## Use Cases
- UI/UX Portfolio
- Base design for Linux-based Indonesian distros
- Open-source education & research project
